# CP1404 Assignment 2 - Song List 2.0 by Kyaw Zaww Linn

A Python project with GUI and Console programs that (re)use classes to manage a list of songs to learn.

# Project Reflection

## 1. How long did the entire project (assignment 2) take you?
The entire project, Assignment 2, took me approximately 7 hours to complete. 
It was a significant undertaking that required careful planning, coding, and testing.
...

## 2. What are you most satisfied with?
I am most satisfied with the user interface (UI) of the project. 
Creating a GUI for the song list management added a professional and user-friendly touch to the application. 
It allows users to interact with the song collection seamlessly.
...

## 3. What are you least satisfied with?
My least satisfaction lies in the initial issue with data deletion from the songs.json file. 
It was a frustrating problem to debug and resolve. 
However, once I identified the issue and corrected the code, the project started working smoothly.
...

## 4. What worked well in your development process?
The use of classes worked exceptionally well in this project. 
The Song and SongCollection classes helped organize and manage song data efficiently. 
They allowed for cleaner code and made it easier to implement features like marking songs as learned or unlearned.
...

## 5. What about your process could be improved the next time you do a project like this?
In the future, I could improve my process by conducting more thorough testing and error handling from the beginning. 
This would help identify issues early and streamline the development process.
...

## 6. Describe what learning resources you used and how you used them.
I utilized various learning resources during this project, including the course materials, documentation for the Kivy framework, and online Python forums. 
These resources were crucial for understanding GUI development and troubleshooting any issues I encountered.
...

## 7. Describe the main challenges or obstacles you faced and how you overcame them.
The main challenge I faced was the issue with data deletion from the songs.json file. 
To overcome it, I reviewed the code meticulously, sought assistance online, and eventually identified that the save_songs method needed to be aligned with the SongCollection class. 
Once I made this correction, the problem was resolved.
...

## 8. Briefly describe your experience using classes and if/how they improved your code.
Using classes significantly improved the code organization and readability. 
The Song and SongCollection classes encapsulated the data and behavior related to songs, making it easier to manage the song list. 
This modular approach improved code maintainability and allowed for easy expansion of features. 
Classes also enabled me to reuse code effectively, enhancing the overall quality of the project.
